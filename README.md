# timetable

## What is `timetable`?
`timetable` is a desktop application built on Electron and React that helps you create a clean and aesthetic timetable with ease.

Currently the involvement of Electron is fairly limited, but I am including it in the stack as once the front-end is complete I would like to add features where a NodeJS server would be very helpful (such as file management or file format conversions).


## Mission Statement

I often find myself making timetables in LibreOffice Calc or Microsoft Excel as they have a convenient way to make tables/grids. I often end up making timetables with HTML/CSS when I want it to look polished and have functionality such as split cells (which I always have to google for the spreadsheets tools I normally use).

My main goals for this project are:
- A timetable that can easy split and merge columns
- Working with times instead of cells, having the app manage timeslots automatically for me
- Become comfortable with React and Electron, building desktop applications.

This lead me to want to make my own timetable application where I can build timetables that look nice and have split cell functionalities.

The goal of this project is to stremline my experience creating timetables quickly and without the need for excessive keystrokes/mouse movements.
